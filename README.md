2. Navigate to the repo or use your favorite IDE (Which of course is Visual Studio Code)
3. Open the docker-compose.yaml file and read the instructions in the comments.
4. Once you thing you are done you can run the following commando:
   ```docker-compose up --build```
   
5. Make sure you understand the output of the command. Did both containers start up correctly? Could the hello-you-app call the webserver service?
6. Try to open the webpage in your local browser
7. Once done run: `docker-compose down`
